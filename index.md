## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://ciela.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciela</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila</a> Institutes at the University of Montreal. 
My research focuses on developing and leveraging machine learning methods to tackle complex challenges in cosmology, pushing the boundaries of what we can learn about the Universe. 
In a broader sense, I am deeply passionate about exploring ways to bridge physics with machine learning to drive scientific discoveries.

Prior to joining the University of Montreal, I earned my PhD in cosmology and machine learning at Université Paris Cité, supported by a <a href="https://u-paris.fr/diip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diiP</a> scholarship. I conducted my research under the supervision of <a href="https://flanusse.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">François Lanusse</a>, <a href="https://aboucaud.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandre Boucaud</a>, and Eric Aubourg.
